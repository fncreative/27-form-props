Pros of Linked Lists
- Dynamic memory (i.e. easy to insert values at head)

Cons of Linked Lists
- O(n) lookup time

Pros of Arrays
- O(1) lookup time

Cons of Arrays
- Fixed Size
- Memory needs to be consecutive

Hashmap
- Introducing the concept of key,value pair
  - the values are what we are trying to store
	- we use the key to be aid the storage process
- behind the scenes, a hashmap contains an ARRAY
- Hashing Process
  - start with the key
	- we transform the key into a number
	- we transfrom the number into an array index 
	- innerArray[hashFunction(key)] = value;

Pros
 - O(1) lookup, insertion AND removal time (single values)

Cons
- Re-sizing the map is VERY expensive
- there is no guaranteed order in the map
- A hashmap sacrifices space for time






 - An object (in JS) is a hashmap that only allows strings as keys.
 - An ES6 map is a hashmap that allows anything as keys.
 - An ES6 set is a hashmap where every value is (by default) true.



 - look for something (an individual element)
 - keep track of something
 - count something
